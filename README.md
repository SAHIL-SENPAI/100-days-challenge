# 🐍 100 Days of Python Projects

Welcome to my **100 Days of Python** journey!
This repository contains all the projects, scripts, and exercises I will create during my 100 days of learning and building with Python.
From basic scripts to more complex projects, I aim to improve my skills and knowledge in Python programming.

## 📅 Journey Overview

Over the course of 100 days, I will be working on various Python projects and tasks, building up from beginner-level projects to more advanced topics.
The goal is to challenge myself and stay consistent, documenting my progress and growth as a developer.

## 🛠️ Projects

Each day I will upload new projects or scripts to this repository. Below is a breakdown of the major categories of projects I plan to work on:

1. **Beginner Projects** (Days 1–20)
   - Basic scripts
   - Number games
   - String manipulation
   - File I/O

2. **Intermediate Projects** (Days 21–50)
   - Data structures and algorithms
   - Web scraping
   - APIs
   - Data analysis (with Pandas)

3. **Advanced Projects** (Days 51–100)
   - Web development (Flask/Django)
   - Machine Learning (with Scikit-Learn)
   - Automation scripts
   - Creating simple bots

## 📂 Project Structure

Each day's project will be saved in its respective folder:

Each folder will contain:
- A **README.md** explaining the project and the concept learned that day.
- The Python script or Jupyter Notebook for the day.

## 🏆 Goals

- **Consistency**: Code every day for 100 days.
- **Learn**: Explore different Python libraries, frameworks, and concepts.
- **Build**: Create practical, usable projects along the way.
